## Ray Tracer

Course project for "Advanced Computer Graphics" course (2014 fall).

A simple ray tracer.

Implemented features: Monte-carlo path tracing, photon mapping, noise texture, bump mapping, volume rendering with multi-scattering, constructive solid geometry.

The code is messy. Do not attempt to build.

Some rendered pictures are included in /pic.
